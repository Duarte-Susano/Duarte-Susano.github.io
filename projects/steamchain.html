        <h6>Description</h6>
        <p>
       Steam Chain is an action-adventure 2D platformer, where you play as the character Fae, 
       a small robot bunny, who is trying to get medicine for his sick mother.
       You will find yourself in this interesting steampunk world, where you need to reach the top of a clockwork tower by jumping,
       swingging on gears and solving puzzles with gears you find along the way.
       Although my main role was programmer, I worked very closely with the game designer to bring all the mechanics, 
       such as the wall jump, the gear swings and the puzzles, as well as the level design to life.

        <h6>Contribution</h6>
        <p>
          Being the first proper game project for everyone in the team, it came with its set of challenges, mostly, on
          the communication and team building side. We were divided into project manager/game designer, programmer, and
          artist, and while the train chugged along without any major catastrophes, not everything went smoothly. Being
          the appointed PM/GD, I tried to do my best to keep the whole thing in a cohesive state, but some concessions
          had to be done regarding the art side of things, and midway through I had to pick the programming gig.

        <p>
          While the core of the game was always the interaction between the platforming elements and the puzzle
          sections, our programmer was having a hard time and seriously considering abandoning the puzzle
          implementation, so I ended up tackling that front. Design wise, I think it turned out alright, at least in
          terms of level design. I tried to adjust the jump arc with the tools I was given, but the end result still
          turned out floaty. Overall, for first proper project, I think it was ok, specially taking into account that
          everyone involved had picked up some necessary skills like coding mere months before.
